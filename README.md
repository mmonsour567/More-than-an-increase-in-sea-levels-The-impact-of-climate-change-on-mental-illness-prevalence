ABSTRACT
Purpose The looming repercussions of climate change threaten the population with an increased prevalence of high-intensity extreme climate events. 
We explored the impact of climate change induced sea level rise and tropical cyclone exposure on mental illness prevalence. We hypothesized that stress 
and trauma caused by these disasters will increase the prevalence of mental illness.
Methods Using three previously collected datasets, normalized tropical cyclone exposure scores were calculated for each subject to determine how exposure 
will affect posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and major depressive disorder (MDD) prevalence. Inundation mapping of various sea level rise and 
storm surge scenarios was performed for a particularly susceptible region, namely Miami-Dade and Broward counties in Florida, to determine the population impact 
of sea level rise and flooding. 
Results We found an elevated risk of mental illness from exposure to more high-intensity tropical cyclones and identifies demographic variables that may 
contribute to this risk. Furthermore, the inundation mapping of Miami-Dade and Broward counties demonstrates severe and widespread impact of sea level rise 
and storm surge on the mental health of its residents.
Conclusion The impacts of climate change have been frequently studied in terms of physical health, natural disaster prevalence, and economic impacts, but rarely 
on mental health burden. However, it is vital that national, state, and local governments develop and deploy plans to address mental health needs along with 
expenditures for protecting infrastructure, the economy, and physical health from the combined effects of sea level rise and climate change-induced natural 
disasters.
